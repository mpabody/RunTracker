# RunTracker
This app allows the user to keep detailed logs of their worksouts and races that they run while tracking how many miles they rack up in a pair of shoes.
I am a runner myself and I wanted to build an application that was practical and useful and also easy to use. I try to get a new pair of shoes after about 400 miles (the recommended mileage for a pair of shoes is 300-500). I wanted the app to track workouts I ran, races I'm interested in running, and had the ability to change a race to a race that I ran and add the shoes I ran it in to track those miles.
